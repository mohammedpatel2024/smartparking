# üöó Smart Parking Spot Detector (Python + OpenCV)

A real-time Parking Spot Detector using Python and computer vision.

- ‚úÖ Detects **free** & **occupied** parking slots instantly  
- ‚úÖ Sends **live updates** to a **Telegram bot**  
- ‚úÖ Visualizes slots in **green (free)** & **red (occupied)**  
- ‚úÖ Built with **OpenCV, NumPy, requests**

This system saves time, reduces traffic congestion, and improves parking management efficiency.  
**Proud to combine technology + problem-solving to make everyday life smarter.**

## üß† How It Works

1. Load a **video** or **webcam** 


2. Read pre-defined **parking slot coordinates** (rectangles/polygons).
3. For each slot, compute an **occupancy score** (pixel density / edges / grayscale).
4. Mark **FREE** (green) or **OCCUPIED** (red) based on a **threshold**.
5. Batch and send **status updates** to a **Telegram bot** at a fixed interval.
